## Design
   ### Colour Scheme
   * Colours used in the project were picked with the main focus on 2 colours:
     * purple (which is the main colour for the brand) as "Lavender field"("Lawendowe Pole") is the name of the company and they use colours associated with their name.
     * turquoise as the company use this colour together with purple in the social media adverts and it looks well for companies associated with sweets, desserts and ice creams.
*  *Adobe Color* was used to create the colour palette
