## Design

### Colour Scheme

* Colours used in the project were picked with the focus on 2 colours:

* purple (which is the main colour for the brand) as "Lavender field"("Lawendowe Pole") is the name of the company and they use colours associated with their name.

* turquoise as the company use this colour together with purple in the social media adverts and it looks well for companies associated with sweets, desserts and ice creams.
* *Adobe Color* was used to create the colour palette

## Typography

 :black_nib:

* The primary font used in this project is **Open Sans** with *sans-serif* as a fallback font. This font is elegant and modern. It offers an excellent reading experience.

## Imagery

### As this website is for an ice cream company, images are a crucial part of this project.
